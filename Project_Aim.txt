# Project Goal: MCP-Powered Agentic RAG

## Objective
Build an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using MCP architecture, including:

- User-facing web UI
- MCP Client for API mediation
- MCP Server (Agent) for logic/routing
- Vector DB Tool and Web Search Tool
- Stepwise, modular, minimal-complexity implementation

## High-Level Workflow
1. User submits query in web app
2. MCP Client forwards query to MCP Server
3. Agent decides whether to use Vector DB, Web Search, or both
4. Aggregated, context-rich answer returned to user

## Guiding Principles
- Each module built incrementally, one at a time
- Simplicity prioritized (avoid Docker, advanced cloud, or exotic frameworks)
- Every code change explained and summarized
